				The current build of Paint On Chain which is open to all users will not change all too much. As the main goal will be working on the full creation suite, which will be exclusive to our NFT holders only.
			</Typography>
			<Spacer vertical spacing={1} />
			<Typography variant={'body1'}>
				The creation suite will have a range of tools, features and extras for holders to be able to create on-chain artwork and even their own on-chain NFT collections - including their own contract.
			</Typography>
			<Spacer vertical spacing={1} />
			<Typography variant={'body1'}>
				To get to our funding goals and be able to build the creation suite, first we'll be growing the community and user base of Paint On Chain. Gathering feedback as we do so.
